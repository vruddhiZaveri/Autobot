# Arduino AutoBot Project ü§ñ

This project is a versatile Arduino-based AutoBot platform, designed to explore and implement various robotic functionalities. It utilizes an HC-05 Bluetooth module for wireless communication and a range of sensors to achieve diverse tasks.

## Sub-Projects üèÜ

* **Automatic Morning Alarm:** Triggers an alarm (buzzer) at a pre-set time.
* **Bluetooth Control:** Allows remote control of the robot's movement via a Bluetooth-enabled device (smartphone/computer).
* **Gyroscope-Based Movement Control:** Enables precise robot movement control using a gyroscope sensor for orientation and rotation.
* **Human Following Bot:** Tracks and follows a human subject using ultrasonic sensors.
* **Line Following Bot:** Follows a black line on a white surface using line-following sensors.
* **Obstacle Avoidance Bot:** Navigates autonomously, avoiding obstacles using ultrasonic sensors.
* **Smart Dustbin:** Automatically opens its lid when an object is detected nearby, using an ultrasonic sensor.
* **Smart Parking System:** Detects the presence of a vehicle in a parking space using an ultrasonic sensor and displays the parking status.
* **Visitor Counter:** Counts the number of people passing through a doorway using an IR sensor.
* **Voice Control Bot:** Responds to voice commands received via Bluetooth to control the robot's actions.
* **Weather Indicator:** Displays weather information (temperature, humidity) using a DHT11/DHT22 sensor.

## Sensors Used ‚ö°

* **HC-05 Bluetooth Module:** For wireless communication and control.
* **Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04):** For distance measurement, used in obstacle avoidance, human following, smart dustbin, and smart parking.
* **Line Following Sensors (Using IR Reflective Sensors):** For line detection.
* **Infrared (IR) Sensors:** For object detection and counting, used in the visitor counter.
* **LM35 Sensor:** For temperature and humidity measurement, used in the weather indicator.
* **Buzzer:** For audio alerts in the morning alarm.
